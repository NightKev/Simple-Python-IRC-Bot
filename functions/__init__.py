http://www.intuit-symbiosis.org/computing or https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyrawirc/ .

*** You need Python to run these files! ***

In this directory should there be two clients:
-- one text client for curses (doesn't work in windows)
-- one gui client using tkinter
-- also one simplistic tkinter client for educative purposes

Edit irc_settings.py with your nickname and server information. Have fun and please be responsible!
